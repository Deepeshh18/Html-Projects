<p>Agriculture or farming is the practice of cultivating plants and livestock.Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago. After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago. Pigs, sheep, and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world.Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output, though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture.
</p><p>he major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, fuels, and raw materials (such as rubber). Food classes include cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, oils, meat, milk, eggs, and fungi. Over one-third of the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the service sector, although in recent decades, the global trend of a decreasing number of agricultural workers continues, especially in developing countries, where smallholding is being overtaken by industrial agriculture and mechanization that brings an enormous crop yield increase.</P><p>
Modern agronomy, plant breeding, agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, and technological developments have sharply increased crop yields, but cause ecological and environmental damage. Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage. Environmental issues include contributions to global warming, depletion of aquifers, deforestation, antibiotic resistance, and other agricultural pollution. Agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation, such as biodiversity loss, desertification, soil degradation, and global warming, all of which can cause decreases in crop yield. Genetically modified organisms are widely used, although some are banned in certain countries.</p>

<h2>Definition of pesticides</h2>
<p>
Agriculture, forestry, aquaculture, food industry, processing, transportation and storage of wood and other biological products are sectors where various pests (e.g. weeds, insects, birds, rodents, fungi, moulds, etc.) can significantly affect the quantity and quality of products. Certain species of pests can also damage buildings, installations, furniture, cloths, etc., spread infectious or cause other diseases. Therefore pest control is an important activity intended to reduce or eliminate yield losses, maintain high quality of products and prevent other undesirable effects that may be caused by pests.

Pest control is implemented by physical, chemical and biological methods and the choice of the particular method depends on various conditions (type of industry, species, amount and distribution of pests, environmental conditions, etc.). The most effective methods of pest control are based on the use of chemicals named ‘pesticides’. The largest users of pesticides are agriculture and forestry. Pesticides are also widely used in different industries, trade, storage and other sectors of economic activity and household. Adequate application of pesticides produces good results in terms of protecting products and improving quality, saving labour costs and achieving a significant economic benefit. [2] [3]

The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) presents following definition of pesticides:

‘Pesticide means any substance, or mixture of substances of chemical or biological ingredients intended for repelling, destroying or controlling any pest, or regulating plant growth’. [4]</p>

Pesticide is a more general term than Plant Protection Product (PPP). Plant protection products are 'pesticides' that protect crops or desirable or useful plants. They contain at least one active substance and have one of the following functions:

protect plants or plant products against pests/diseases, before or after harvest;
influence the life processes of plants (such as substances influencing their growth, excluding nutrients);
preserve plant products;
destroy or prevent growth of undesired plants or parts of plants.
The term 'pesticide' is often used interchangeably with 'plant protection product', however, pesticide is a broader term that also covers non plant/crop uses, for example biocides. Within the EU legislation, there are separate legislative acts for PPP and biocides (see below) [5].
<h2>Use of plant protection products in the EU</h2>
<p>
Statistical data on the overall use of pesticides are collected by Eurostat and the European Crop Protection Association (ECPA). In 2007 Eurostat produced a report on the use of PPPs in the European Union in co-operation with ECPA in 2007. The report included detailed data on EU-15 from 1992 to 2003. Separate data of the use of PPP in each EU country were also presented. Amount of used PPP was reported by ECPA as tonnes of active substances for the main PPP categories (fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, and plant growth regulators) [12].</P>

Updated key figures on the consumption of pesticides are available at the Eurostat website since it is one of the 28 agri-environmental indicators that have been set up in order to monitor the integration of environmental concerns into the Common agricultural policy (CAP) of the EU. Data show that over the period 2011-2017, the sales of pesticides remained more or less stable at around 380,000 tonnes per year in the EU (EU-28) [13].</p><p> Furthermore on the ECPA website an interactive tool is available for consulting industry statistics on the value and volume of the plant protection production [14].</p>
